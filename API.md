The api needs to do the following:
getUsers, getUser(id), pushUser.

WE are not goign to save any data.
PushUser will only be called when a NEW user that is NOT in the database logs into the webpage.
GetUsers MIGHT be necessary?
getUser(id) will get the user who is logging in for this game.

Why are we doing this?
Because we are logging in through discord. IDK.
ALso because mayhbe the winner, might get some rewards for winning and participants for participating.
